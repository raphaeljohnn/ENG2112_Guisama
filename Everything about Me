My name is Raphael John Gabriel Fernando Guisama, a 19-year old
student studying Electronics Engineering at the University of Santo Tomas.
I live at Concepcion Uno, Marikina City, the shoe capital of the 
Philippines and at the same time, the place where I was born way back 
19th of May year 2000. My hobbies include playing volleyball,
listening to music and watching films and series that fits my interest.
I'm lucky God blessed me with amazing parents, Jewella Guisama and John Eric Guisama
who are both hard-working and loving parents. I have a younger sibling, Ethan Joshua Nikholai
Guisama, who's currently studying in my alma mater, Our Lady of Perpetual Succor
College in Marikina where I graduated from. As the eldest son, I will do my very best and 
give my everything to achieve my dreams and become an Engineer one day. I know it will be a 
tough road, but I won's stop working for it, not just for myself, but most especially for 
my family.
